/**

File to handle global settings
In theory this should be stored in GLib.Settings - but since that requires a load of infrastructure to create
we will stick to "~/.config/roobuilder.json" for now


we used to store it in '.Builder/Project.list' .. but that's going to change..


// this should be available via BuilderApplicaiton.settings
